# PintOS

The Stanford OS design project. It consists of 4 phases. Till now, I've designed phases 1, 2 and 3.
Each phase is in a branch:
* Phase 1: alarm code is in a separate branch (because it is used in phases 3 and 4 too), and the whole phase 1 is in main.
* Phase 2: userprog (has a bug which is fixed in phase 3.. will merge)
* Phase 3: phase_3
